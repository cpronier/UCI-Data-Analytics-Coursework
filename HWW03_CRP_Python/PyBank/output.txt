The next section is not working correctly and I can't figure out what the logic error is in the code. I am trying to create a new list which contains the differences between values in the previous list I created so I can calculate the average, min and max. I spent 3 hours tinkering with it but still cannot figure out what is wrong. So I am going to improvise this next part so I can at least show some additional work.
